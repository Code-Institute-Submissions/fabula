FABULA & HEALING Center

Fabula Yoga Center, offers a wide variety of yoga types, classes starts early in the morning and ends late in the afternoon. 
The Center offers flavour water, yoga material, high certified teachers at a very reasonable price by month.

UX
This website is for any aged person who is interested in yoga practise. Because is an specialised yoga center they focus on different types of practise for everyone. 
They offer the first class for free, so we want to focus on that since is the pathway to get the client once they try the class.

Our Persona is Magdalena, she is 38 lives in Marrakech and is a French and Spanish teacher at the local school. 
Laura likes doing yoga in specialized centers, sheâ€™d like to know what kind of classes do they have and what are schedules, prices and location of the Yoga Center and contact them to start as soon as possible.

We are going to implement the information by priorities:

1. FIRST SECTION / HEADER: We want to show the offer - First Class for free
2. SECOND SECTION / CLASSES: We want to show the types and levels of yoga offered - We will link to Wikipedia for the user read further
3. THIRD SECTION / CALENDAR: We want to show the calendar for the week so the user can already know if they can fit or not in the center.
4. FORTH SECTION / PLANS: We want to show the prices, divided in 3 types depending on the number of classes you take a week.
5. FIFTH SECTION / CENTER: We want to show an overview of the installations and the main features they offer.
6. SIXTH SECTION / REVIEWS: We want to share three reviews from Fabula center clients. 
7. SIXTH SECTION / CONTACT: We want to share location and a short book form for any inquiry apart from the book online.

There will be two types of contact:
- BOOK ONLINE
- CONTACT US


Features

1. FIRST SECTION / HEADER: Book Online Button - Book Online Page where the user will have to fill in with:
    - Name & Surname
    - email
    - phone number
    - type of class
    - day preferred
    - time preferred
    - comments

    We will write a note: "You'll receive an email with your class confirmation soon"
    ^ couldn't do that at the end - didn't know how.

2. SECOND SECTION / CLASSES: Classes Cards with Wikipedia link to learn further. Book Online button at the bottom of the section.

3. THIRD SECTION / CALENDAR: The idea is to show the full calendar in one overview, for that I experimented the following process:

The Calendar was going to be an image responsive, then I thought of doing a tab collapse in phone and uncollapsed in big screen, 
then I thought it would be ver boring to open tab per tab in the phone to see the whole programme of the Center. 
So I decided of doing a responsive table with bootstrap "table-responsive" that included a horizontal scrolling bar.
That is the reason why the design doesn't fit with the prototype, wasn't able to set up columns for the borders so the table is set up in row, I did some research to 
make the table in columns instead of rows but couldn't make it and was taking too long and had to continue with the rest at that point.

4. FORTH SECTION / PRICES: 

There is 3 types of informative prices, if you want to book online you'll always go to the booking online page because I can't implement the payment thing yet.
The idea is to try the class then get your membership but when I am able I'd like to add the auto payment to have your membership straight away.

5. FIFTH SECTION / CENTER INSTALLATIONS:

I use a carousel in order to add all the info regarding the center, more like a short "about us" in just one section. In mobile phone the text is out of the carousel so it's
better seen.

6. SIXTH SECTION / REVIEWS:

I added reviews as an extra section but it's not in the menu, should follow the installation as an extra feedback about the place.

7. SIXTH SECTION / CONTACT:

There is a map that links you directly to google maps. At the right part I added a quick contact form for general inquiries in case you are not ready to book a free online class yet.

8. FOOTER:

Large Screens: Logo Linked to the main page + email link, phone link to whatsapp app, google maps link to location + social media links.
Mobile Screens: I hidded the logo to save more space.


BOOK ONLINE SECTIONS:

1. Navbar & Footer the same as main page + Book Online form filling the page.

BOOK ONLINE FORM:
    - Name & Surname
    - email
    - phone number
    - type of class
    - day preferred
    - time preferred
    - comments

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

I would like to add a platform where the user can attend to the guestlist of the class by using his private area. 
I would like to make online bookings with payment hub.
I would like to have a more dinamic calendar to be able to access the class guestlist clicking the class on the calendar.
